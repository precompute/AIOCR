* AIOCR : OCR Images via API and copy to clipboard
This program:
1. Creates a random filename, christened by ~pwgen~
2. Takes a screenshot with ~scrot~ and stores it in /tmp/OCR
3. Gets its mimetype (ancient artifact)
4. encodes to ~base64~
5. OCR’s via API
6. Copies result to clipboard with ~xclip~
7. Writes result to file in /tmp/OCR
8. Sends a notification with ~notify~-send


** Required Tools
Requires the following tools:
- ~pwgen~
- ~scrot~
- ~base64~
- ~xclip~
- ~notify-send~

** API Key
You need to s/YOUR_API_KEY_HERE/[ API key from https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys ]/

** Usage
Bind it to a shortcut.  Your cursor will change, this is ~scrot~ ’s  doing.  Select an area and it will (hopefully) be transcribed.

** Caveats
- The prompt is geared towards Org-Mode users.  Modify it to get output in MarkDown (or whatever you prefer).
- It uses a free model and it sometimes drops requests.  Change to a better / paid model to increase reliability.
